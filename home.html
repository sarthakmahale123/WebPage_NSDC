        <p class="heading">Big Data</p><br>
        <p>Big Data is a field of study that involves data management and analytics, intending to uncover hidden patterns and unknown correlations within large datasets. Big Data encompasses increased computing power (in terms of capacity and speed), cloud storage, advanced software tools (data visualization, etc.), open-source platforms such as Apache Hadoop, NoSQL databases like Cassandra or MongoDB, real-time analytics, data modeling, and ultimately business intelligence.Big data is crucial because it allows you to see the whole picture, making better-informed decisions that will enable your company to operate more efficiently with less risk.Big data can also help increase market share, as it helps companies identify the needs of their customers and create products that meet those needs. It can provide an insight into what consumers like or don’t like; this information is precious as it allows companies to improve and redesign their products to appeal more to the consumer.</p>

        <p class="heading">Data Science</p><br>
        <p> Data Science is the technology that processes raw data into information offering business insights. Today there is a huge demand for data science professionals. They are offered handsome salaries because of the complexity of their job as well as the shortage of professionals with the needed experience as well as expertise. Data Science professionals include Data Scientists, Data Architects, Data Engineers, Data Administrators, and others.Knowledge of Mathematics and Statistics is important to implement Data Science in any organization. The activities of data science professionals are to create algorithms to understand and analyze complex as well as large volumes of data.If you are still using human employees and manual methods to process data then it is the right time to adopt data science technology. It will definitely save you time, money, and effort both in the short term and long term. Remember that your competitors may already be implementing data science in their operations. Using data science will make you competitive and improve business performance as well as other critical parameters. If you have employees skilled in data science start using their skills.</p>

        <p class="heading">Data visualization</p><br>
        <p>Data visualization is the graphical representation of information and data in a pictorial or graphical format(Example: charts, graphs, and maps). Data visualization tools provide an accessible way to see and understand trends, patterns in data, and outliers. Data visualization tools and technologies are essential to analyzing massive amounts of information and making data-driven decisions. The concept of using pictures is to understand data that has been used for centuries. General types of data visualization are Charts, Tables, Graphs, Maps, Dashboards.Data visualization is also a medium to tell a data story to the viewers. The visualization can be used to present the data facts in an easy-to-understand form while telling a story and leading the viewers to an inevitable conclusion. This data story, like any other type of story, should have a good beginning, a basic plot, and an ending that it is leading towards.For example, if a data analyst has to craft a data visualization for company executives detailing the profits on various products, then the data story can start with the profits and losses of various products and move on to recommendations on how to tackle the losses.</p>
